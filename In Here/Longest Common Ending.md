## ‚úèÔ∏èMy Solution:
```
def longest_common_ending(txt1, txt2):
	if len(txt1) == len(txt2):
		small = txt1
		large = txt2
	else:
		small = min(txt1,txt2,key = len)
		large = max(txt1,txt2,key = len)
	for i in range(len(small)-1):
		if small[i:] in large: return small[i:]
	return ""
```
Remark: Could have been done in lot less lines by using 'endswith()' method.
